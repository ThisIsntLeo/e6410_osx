Just like my macOS on Surface repo, this is about getting OSX on the Dell Latitude E6410.
This runs on Intel's Arrandale series of chips.
I'm testing it on an i5 560M model, but here is the CPU list
i3 3#0M
i5 5#0M
i7 6#0M
This contains less kexts as unlike Micro$oft, doesn't have proprietary KB amd Trackpad modules. Screw Micro$oft's aggregator module.

The OpenIntelWireless team might also be involved in this one as it also runs off an Intel wireless module.
